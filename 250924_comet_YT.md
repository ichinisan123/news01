This YouTube video from the channel "ぷらぐら" (Puragura) provides a review and demonstration of **"Comet," an AI-powered browser created by Perplexity**. While initially skeptical, the creator found the browser surprisingly powerful and enjoyable, particularly its ability to automate tasks.

Here is a breakdown of the key features and points discussed in the video:

### What Can the AI Browser Do?

The video showcases several practical examples of Comet's capabilities, which go far beyond simple page summarization.

*   **Automated Browser Operation**: You can give Comet instructions in natural language to perform complex actions. For instance, the creator asked it to "create a walking route on Google Maps to tour the sacred sites of Steins;Gate." The browser automatically searched for information, identified locations from blog posts, and plotted them on the map, completing the route in about two and a half minutes with minimal errors.
*   **Advanced Tab Management**: Comet can manage browser tabs based on commands. The creator demonstrated asking it to find recently announced games and then open each one in a new tab. It can also group tabs by criteria (like game publisher) and close duplicate tabs, which is helpful when you have many tabs open.
*   **Enhanced YouTube Interaction**: While Comet can summarize YouTube videos, it also performs more advanced tasks. The creator successfully instructed it to find a previously watched video and start playback from a specific point by controlling the seek bar. It can also extract the full titles of the 10 most recent videos on a channel.
*   **Cross-Tab Information Synthesis**: A powerful feature is Comet's ability to analyze the content across all open tabs. The creator demonstrated this by searching for PC game recommendations, opening multiple personal blogs in new tabs, and then asking Comet to synthesize the information from all articles to identify the most highly-rated games. This is also useful for comparing product reviews.
*   **Repetitive Task Automation**: The browser can automate tedious tasks. For example, when multiple Amazon product pages were open, Comet was asked to collect and list the shortened URL for each item. This process took only about 40 seconds, much faster than doing it manually.
*   **Smart History Search**: Comet can search your browsing history using natural language queries. You can ask for things like "that Wikipedia page I saw recently" or specify a date range to find a page you visited last week, saving you from manually scrolling through your history.

### Key Features and Characteristics

*   **Chromium-Based**: The browser is built on Chromium, so it supports Chrome extensions and functions similarly to other popular browsers like Chrome and Edge.
*   **Perplexity as Default Search**: The default search engine is Perplexity, which provides AI-generated answers directly in the address bar. While this can be useful, it may feel awkward if you just want to navigate to a specific website. The search engine can be changed in the settings, and a shortcut (Shift + Enter) allows for a quick Google search.
*   **Built-in Summarization**: Comet has a native feature to summarize web pages, which can be activated with a keyboard shortcut (Alt + S) and appears in a sidebar. The creator notes its fast response time and the ability to ask follow-up questions directly in the sidebar.

### How to Get the Browser

As of the video's recording, Comet is in a beta phase and not publicly available. The video lists several ways to potentially gain access, such as:
*   Signing up for a waitlist.
*   Getting an invitation (which is how the creator got access).
*   Subscribing to Perplexity's "Max" plan.
*   Taking advantage of student or PayPal campaigns.

### **Important Security Warning**

The video stresses a **critical point about security**. Because Comet automates browser actions, it carries certain risks. The creator references a report from Brave that warns of a potential vulnerability where malicious, hidden instructions on a webpage could be picked up by the AI. This could lead to the AI unintentionally sending sensitive information, such as your email and one-time passwords, potentially compromising your Perplexity account.

While Perplexity is reportedly working on these issues, the creator advises users to be constantly aware of the risks and **recommends against using the browser for work or with sensitive information for now**.

In conclusion, the creator was impressed with Comet's automation capabilities, calling it futuristic and fun to use, but strongly advises users to be cautious due to the security concerns associated with its beta status.
